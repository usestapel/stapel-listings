"""Canonical-prefix URLconf for contract emission (contract-pipeline.md §2).

Unlike stapel-forms/-chat/-search (whose own ``urls.py`` bakes the full
``api/v1/`` segment in), stapel-listings' ``urls.py`` contributes only the
mandatory ``v1/`` sub-prefix and documents that the HOST mounts it under its
own ``.../api/`` prefix — exactly what stapel-example-monolith does for its
siblings (``path("cdn/api/", include("stapel_cdn.urls"))``,
``path("categories/api/", include("stapel_categories.urls"))``). This mirrors
that recipe for listings: ``listings/api/`` + the module's own ``v1/`` gives
the canonical ``/listings/api/v1/…`` prefix.

Declared separately from the test urlconf so the contract-emission mount can
never silently drift from the module's documented public mount recipe.
