"""Every code this module BORROWS has a string in every language it renders.

Not "every code this module owns" — that is the house gate, and it is green on
a deployment where thirteen of these codes render in English. ``errors.py``
imports ``stapel_attributes.errors`` on purpose: the draft/publish path
re-raises that library's per-field validation codes at the top level of a
refusal, so thirteen ``stapel_attributes``-owned keys enter the error registry
— and the ``docs/errors.json`` — of every host that mounts this module. Forty
more arrive the same way from ``stapel_core``. **The registry travelled; the
strings did not.**

The two halves of that asymmetry are the two gates here:

* :func:`test_every_borrowed_code_has_a_string_in_every_rendered_language`
  resolves the registry the way a host's loader does — through
  ``stapel_core.i18n.catalogs.load_app_catalogs``, which walks the package
  directory of every registered error owner, not just INSTALLED_APPS. It
  answers "does the installed dependency carry the sentence".

* :func:`test_the_floor_of_every_upstream_error_owner_ships_those_strings`
  answers the other half — "can a host install a version where it does not".
  It reads the floors this package declares. ``stapel-attributes>=0.8.1``
  admitted five releases (0.8.1 … 0.9.2) whose wheels carry ``errors.py`` and
  no ``translations/`` directory at all, and ``stapel-core>=0.60.6`` admitted
  loaders that could not find a catalog for a library outside INSTALLED_APPS.
  A floor that admits those is the defect; the coverage test above cannot see
  it, because pip installs the newest thing the range allows.

Nothing here copies an upstream string into this package. That "fix" is what
:func:`test_this_module_ships_no_foreign_key` forbids: core's
``check_translation_catalogs`` calls a translated key another package owns,
while its owner already ships that language, a ``foreign`` error — and
declaring the override would make this repo the maintainer of a second,
drifting copy of somebody else's text. The strings reach a host from the
owner's wheel, which is where they stay correct.

**What is deliberately NOT gated here.** This module ships no ``translations/``
directory of its own, so the seventeen codes it OWNS render their English
literal in every locale. That is a real gap and a different piece of work — a
catalogue this package would author, review and own, not a dependency range —
and inventing the strings here to make a number go green would be the same
"fix by copying" this file exists to prevent, pointed inward.
:func:`test_a_catalogue_this_module_ships_covers_every_key_it_owns` is the
trip-wire that arms itself the day such a catalogue appears.
