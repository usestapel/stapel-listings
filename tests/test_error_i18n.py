"""Every code this module returns has a string in every language it renders.

Both halves: the codes it BORROWS (reachable through a dependency floor) and
the codes it OWNS (translated in ``translations/errors.<lang>.json``, shipped
in this wheel).

The borrowed half came first, and is the larger asymmetry. ``errors.py``
imports ``stapel_attributes.errors`` on purpose: the draft/publish path
re-raises that library's per-field validation codes at the top level of a
refusal, so thirteen ``stapel_attributes``-owned keys enter the error registry
— and the ``docs/errors.json`` — of every host that mounts this module. Forty
more arrive the same way from ``stapel_core``. **The registry travelled; the
strings did not.**

The two halves of that asymmetry are the two gates here:

* :func:`test_every_borrowed_code_has_a_string_in_every_rendered_language`
  resolves the registry the way a host's loader does — through
  ``stapel_core.i18n.catalogs.load_app_catalogs``, which walks the package
  directory of every registered error owner, not just INSTALLED_APPS. It
  answers "does the installed dependency carry the sentence".

* :func:`test_the_floor_of_every_upstream_error_owner_ships_those_strings`
  answers the other half — "can a host install a version where it does not".
  It reads the floors this package declares. ``stapel-attributes>=0.8.1``
  admitted five releases (0.8.1 … 0.9.2) whose wheels carry ``errors.py`` and
  no ``translations/`` directory at all, and ``stapel-core>=0.60.6`` admitted
  loaders that could not find a catalog for a library outside INSTALLED_APPS.
  A floor that admits those is the defect; the coverage test above cannot see
  it, because pip installs the newest thing the range allows.

Nothing here copies an upstream string into this package. That "fix" is what
:func:`test_this_module_ships_no_foreign_key` forbids: core's
``check_translation_catalogs`` calls a translated key another package owns,
while its owner already ships that language, a ``foreign`` error — and
declaring the override would make this repo the maintainer of a second,
drifting copy of somebody else's text. The strings reach a host from the
owner's wheel, which is where they stay correct.

**The owned half.** Until 0.22.8 this module shipped no ``translations/``
directory at all, so the seventeen codes it OWNS rendered their English
registry literal in every locale — on a Russian storefront whose core this
library is. That gap is a catalogue this package authors, reviews and owns,
never a dependency range and never a copy of somebody else's text, and it is
gated from :func:`test_a_catalogue_this_module_ships_covers_every_key_it_owns`
down: every owned key present and non-empty in every shipped language, no
foreign key, every ``{param}`` slot of the canon preserved, and the shipped
language set exactly the gated one — plus the packaging, because three
sibling libraries authored a correct catalogue and shipped a wheel without it.
